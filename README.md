# Handshakes 
In the most awkward interaction I had yesterday I realised I'm horrible at handshakes. 
For some reason i can't remember the sophisticated movements my hands are supposed to do.
Left? Right? ...? Why is it so complicated. Damn this shit is hard. 

Okay so the plan is to make software that tracks hands, so i can practice my handshakes by 
myself... Wow, that is the saddest sentence i have ever written. It's okay I'll think of a 
better way of writing it later.
